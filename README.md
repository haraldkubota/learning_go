## Python

Python does its job, but it's not my thing the more I use it.
The libraries are awesome though, so I can get a lot of work done via Python.
But it's not...fun.

For work it's THE choice simply because everyone knows Python.
You don't want to be the only one who can edit code because
you picked an obscrure language.

## Alternatives

NodeJS is nicer and much more fun.
Dart is even better (like JS minus the bad stuff), but lacks libraries.
Rust has the great concept of ownership, but the syntax is hard to
remember unless you do Rust every day.

## Go

Go on the other hand: very pragmatic, simple, powerful.
Creates stand-alone binaries. Works well with IaaS and related tools.

So Go it is.
